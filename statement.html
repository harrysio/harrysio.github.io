<h1>Hi, I am Harry Sio nice to meet you, and I come from Macau. If you donâ€™t know where is Macau, it is near next to Hong Kong. I guess one day Macau will be as famous as Hong Kong. it is shy to tell you that I am an artist exploring the things I love such as nature, k-drama, and the Bible.<br>
  <p></p>

I really like to watch k-drama, and I spend 25 hours a day on it. I believe I am learning Korean at the same time, as I am interested in language. I realize I have a slightly different character when I speak another language. I hope I am funny when I am speaking English lol. <br> <p></p>
I also like reading, and recently I am addicted to the bible. I assume that I will make art out of bible in the future like animation, illustration, or future media. <br> <p></p>
Lastly, I realize I like to take pictures of nature when I came to the US. I feel incredibly satisfied when I share the pictures I took of nature.
